A couple of years ago I purchased an IBM 5150 off of Craigslist.
It came with the IBM 5151 monochrome green monitor. The PC actually
works too.

The only thing that didn't work was the included keyboard. I assume
the keyboard was using the AT protocol but the IBM 5150 requires
a keyboard that uses the XT protocol (or maybe it's the other way
around...). I ended up buying a keyboard off of ebay that has a
switch for choosing either XT or AT mode and it worked fine.

The monitor has a crack in the case which I am working on fixing. Other
than that the monitor is fine.

The 5.25 inch floppy drives are the biggest problem. One drive seems
to be stuck and the other I am not sure about. I don't have a proper
bootable floppy disk so I am not sure if the drive is not working or
if it's the floppy disk I am trying to use that is the problem.

The PC came with a ram expansion board as well as a Hardcard. The
PC will not even boot at all with the hardcard installed. Without
a floppy or the hardcard the PC boots to the IBM Cassette Basic.
